# Technical Documentation: Retro Pong Game

## Overview
Pong is a classic 2D table tennis game originally developed by Atari in 1972. The game features two paddles and a ball, where players aim to score points by getting the ball past their opponent’s paddle. This documentation outlines the design and implementation of a retro-style Pong game with simple graphics and mechanics.

### Game Specifications
#### General
- Genre: Arcade, Sports
- Players: 1-2 (Single-player vs AI or Multiplayer)
- Platform: Cross-platform (Desktop, Web, or Mobile depending on implementation)
- Resolution: 800x600 pixels (scalable for retro aesthetic)
- Frame Rate: 60 FPS

#### Game Elements
- Paddles:
  - Two vertical rectangles (one per player).
  - Size: 10px (width) x 100px (height).
  - Movement: Up and down within screen bounds.
  - Speed: 5px per frame.
  - Player 1 controls: W (up), S (down).
  - Player 2 controls: Up Arrow (up), Down Arrow (down) or AI-controlled.
- Ball:
  - Square or circular sprite (10x10px).
  - Initial speed: 4px per frame in both X and Y directions.
  - Speed increase: +0.5px per hit (up to a max of 10px).
  - Bounces off paddles and top/bottom walls.
- Score:
  - Displayed at the top center of the screen (e.g., "Player 1: 0 Player 2: 0").
  - Increments when the ball passes a paddle.

#### Screen:
- Black background with white elements (retro monochrome style).
- Center line (dashed) to divide the playfield.

### Gameplay Rules
- The ball starts in the center, moving toward a random player.
- Players move paddles to hit the ball back and forth.
- If the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player scores a point, and the ball resets to the center.
- First player to reach 10 points wins (optional win condition).

### System Architecture
#### Core Components
- Game Loop:
  - Handles input, updates game state, and renders graphics.
  - Runs at 60 FPS.
- Input Handler:
  - Detects key presses for paddle movement.
- Physics Engine:
  - Manages ball movement, collision detection, and bouncing.
- Rendering Engine:
  - Draws paddles, ball, score, and center line on the screen.
- AI (Optional):
  - Controls Player 2’s paddle in single-player mode.

### Development Environment
#### Tools
- Game Engine: Unity (preferred) or Godot
- Programming Language: C# (preferred) or GDScript (Godot)
